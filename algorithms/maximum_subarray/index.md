# 题目

Given an integer array `nums`, 

find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 

which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## 例子

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

## 说明

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, 

try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, 

which is more subtle.
